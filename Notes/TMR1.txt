TIMER1:
-16-bit timer/counter
-consits of two registers(TMR1L,TMR1H)
-can count up to 65535
-can be used in two modes (Timer mode, Counter mode) ?
features:
-programmable internal or external clock source
-readable and writeable
-software programmable PSA up to 1:8
-Internal or external clock select
-Interrupt on overflow from FFFh to 00h
-EdgeSelect for external clock

Timer1 in ASYN counter Mode:

If control bit1 T1SYNC of the T1CON reg is set (1), the external clock input is not synch
The timer increments asynch to the internal phase clock, If the external clock source is selected then the timer will continue to run during sleep mode, and can genertae
an interrupt on overflow. which will wake the processor up.
In synchronous Counter mode, Timer1 cannot be used as a time base for capture or compare operations.
