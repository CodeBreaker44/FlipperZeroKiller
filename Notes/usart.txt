PIC16F877A Serial Communication Tutorial
PIC16F877A comes with inbuilt USART which can be used for Synchronous/Asynchronous communication. USART is a two-wire communication system in which the data flow serially. USART is also a full-duplex communication, which means you can send and receive data at the same time which can be used to communicate with peripheral devices, such as CRT terminals and personal computers.

The USART can be configured in the following modes:

Asynchronous (full-duplex)
Synchronous – Master (half-duplex)
Synchronous – Slave (half-duplex)



Registers used for Serial Communication
TXSTA (Transmit Status And Control Register)
RCSTA (Receive Status And Control Register)
SPBRG (USART Baud Rate Generator)
TXREG (USART Transmit Register)
RCREG (USART Receiver Register)
